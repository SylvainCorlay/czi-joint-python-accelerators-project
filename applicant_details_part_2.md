Pierre Augier is a CNRS researcher at Universit√© Grenoble Alpes specialized in
geophysical fluid dynamics. After his PhD, he started to work more on
developing scientific applications with open-source methods and in Python.

In 2014, he created the [FluidDyn project](https://fluiddyn.readthedocs.io)
(Augier et al. 2019), which goal is to foster open-science and open-source in
fluid dynamics. FluidDyn is mainly a set of Python packages to study fluids
with different methods: laboratory experiments (fluidlab), simulations
(fluidfft, fluidsim and fluidfoam) and data processing (fluidimage). In 2018,
Pierre Augier created [Transonic](https://bitbucket.org/fluiddyn/transonic) to
accelerate Python-Numpy code in the FluidDyn packages.
