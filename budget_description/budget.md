It is just a draft where I list possible costs to see what we can finance!

## Common costs

- $5,000 for travels and meetings

- $15,000 for our final workshop with tutorials and sprints. We want to be able
to invite (i) people from scientific Python libraries which could potentially
used our results and (ii) people involved in new and promissing projects like
HPy and EPython. We will look for other sources of funding to be able to invite
people.

- $75,000 to hire a developer during one year ($65,000 + 15% indirect costs).

## For Transonic and the developer hired for the project

- $5,000 of equipment

- $2,500 for an internship (LowLevelCallable + backend Weld + document backends as extensions)

- $7,500 for publications and conferences (Euroscipy, PyConFr, PyConDe, ...).
We want to be able to invite contributors to present the project in
conferences.

## Pythran

- $35,000 for Serge Guelton's work

- $2,500 for an internship (work on issues #1059 and #1002)

- $2,500 for conferences

## Cython

- $60,000 for Stefan Behnel's work.

## Numba
