other costs, and up to 15% indirect costs (excluding equipment and
subcontracts).

- Indirect costs are limited to up to 15% of direct costs and are included within
the annual budget total. Indirect costs may not be assessed on capital
equipment or subcontracts, but subcontractors may include up to 15% indirect
costs of their direct costs.

- Budget should be requested in US dollars.

- International grantees must use all grant funds exclusively for activities
conducted outside the United States of America. Travel expenses to the United
States (including round-trip tickets) should not be covered from the requested

Zuckerberg Initiative will work closely with successful applicants to arrive at
a mutually acceptable budget after review.
