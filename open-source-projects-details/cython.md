# Software Project Details

Complete the following for each software project that will be supported by the
grant:

- Software project name: Cython
- Homepage URL: https://cython.org/
- Hosting platform: GitHub
- Main code repository: https://github.com/cython/cython
- DOI of major publication(s) describing software project: 10.1109/MCSE.2010.118
- Social media handles: None
- Do you or software project key personnel have commit rights to the code repositories for this software project? yes
- Short description of the software project (maximum of 200 words)

  Cython is an optimising static compiler for both the Python programming language and the extended Cython programming language.
  The Cython language additionally supports calling C functions and declaring C types on variables and class attributes.
  This allows the compiler to generate very efficient C code from Cython code and makes writing C extensions for Python as easy as Python itself.

# List of Known Key Personnel

Key personnel are people involved in the software project who will be supported by the grant if the application is successful. Complete the following for each (up to 5) (required); enter n/a if any field is not applicable. Personnel to be hired that has not been identified at this time can be listed in the budget section. You may need to use the scroll bar at the bottom of the table to scroll right to view and to complete all fields. Alternatively, you can tab to move through and complete the fields. To add another person/row (up to five), click the box at the end of the row. We collect (optional) gender statistics about the applicant team in order to study the gender diversity of teams applying for funding and to learn about diversity trends in the field. We will not consider these gender statistics as part of final grantmaking decisions.
