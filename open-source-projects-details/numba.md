- Short description of the software project (maximum of 200 words):

Numba is a just-in-time compiler for Python functions based on the LLVM
compiler library. Numba is focused on numerical and scientific use cases,
supporting a subset of Python built-in types as well as NumPy arrays and
functions.  Numba can be used to generate and execute optimized machine code
on several CPU targets (x86, x86_64, ARMv7, ARMv8, PPC) and GPU targets
(NVIDIA and AMD).  Additionally, Numba supports more advanced code generation,
like automatic multithreading, generation of array functions for CPU and GPU
targets, and creation of C callbacks for external libraries.

    - Gitter: 392 users in Numba Q&A channel and 46 users in Numba development channel

### Size of the largest potential user base:

- Estimate the potential number of unique users who could adopt this software project in the relevant field/discipline and explanation, if needed. You can use as guidance the number of users of comparable software projects, the number of papers published in the domain to which the software project is applicable, number of labs able to adopt the software project, etc.

    - Many users benefit from Numba when other Python projects use it to accelerate their implementations.  This puts Numba's potential indirect user base over 100,000 users.  Direct users of Numba are in the 10,001-100,000 scale, as suggested by the GitHub dependent repository count.

- List of upstream, downstream, or related software projects that the team is contributing to or receiving contributions from.
    - Numba is a core dependency for packages like:
        - UMAP
        - LibROSA
        - RAPIDS
        - Awkward Array
    - Numba will be an optional dependency of Pandas starting with the 1.0 release.
