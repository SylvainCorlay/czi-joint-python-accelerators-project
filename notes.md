# The Join Python accelerators project

We create for this grant a collaboration between developers working on
different Python accelerators. This group aims at improving the situation of
Python developers and users in terms of performance of scientific Python codes.

Currently, there are many interesting projects but we also see a fragmented
situation, with incompatible accelerators.

- High-level and low-level codes. Numpy needs vectorized code but some
accelerators are very ineffective with such style of coding.

- A community split between expert developers and simple users.

- Libraries (for example Scipy, Pandas and the scikits) discuss about using
alternative accelerators internally, but...

We, participants to the Join Python accelerators project, think that it should
be able to write very effective scientist library and applications just in
clean and modern Python.

For this grant, we propose to improve the situation by (i) providing one modern
Python API (in a package called transonic) to accelerate numerical Python code
with different accelerators and (ii) improving interoperability and
compatibility between the different Python accelerators.

For this grant, we will specifically work with scikit-image core developers on
real-world numerical codes taken from scikit-image. Direct improvements of
scikit-image and of the accelerators. Indirect impacts in the whole scientific
Python ecosystem.

Future, HPy and Pypy...
