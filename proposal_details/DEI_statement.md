# DEI statement

All participating projects have always accepted contributions and facilitated
project discussions online and in real life (such as conferences or sprints)
without looking at the people involved or excluding people based on personal
properties, preferences or prejudices.

However, we are aware that diversity and inclusion does not come for free,
but requires active encouragement to involve people who are in some way
disadvantaged compared to the usual majority groups of easily participating
people.  This encouragement needs time on top of that spent on project
development and maintenance, which is difficult to find in the day-to-day
work of volunteer project maintainers.

We would therefore like to take the opportunity of this CZI grant to improve
our communication towards potential contributor groups who have not been
widely involved in our projects in the past.  The Python community is in the
very fortunate situation of being generally known for its openness, and we
would like to grow the same for our specific projects by participating and
helping in local diversity meetings in the Python and Data area, and by
investing both our time and a part of our conference budget into related
events that we could co-organise together with local meetup groups.


Numba does not currently have an official Code of Conduct, but will be working
to adopt one modeled after the Pandas Contributor Code of Conduct during the
first quarter of 2020.
