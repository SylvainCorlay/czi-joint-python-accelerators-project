# DEI statement

All participating projects have always accepted contributions and facilitated
discussions online and in real life (such as conferences or sprints) without
looking at the people involved or excluding people based on personal
properties, preferences or prejudices.

However, we are aware that diversity and inclusion does not come for free, but
requires active encouragement to involve people who are in some way
disadvantaged compared to the usual majority groups of easily participating
people. This encouragement needs time on top of that spent on project
development and maintenance, which is difficult to find in the day-to-day work
of volunteer maintainers.

We would therefore like to take the opportunity of this CZI grant to improve
our communication towards potential contributor groups who have not been widely
involved in our projects in the past. The Python community is in the very
fortunate situation of being generally known for its openness, and we would
like to grow the same for our specific projects by participating and helping in
local diversity meetings in the Python and Data area, and by investing both our
time and a part of our conference budget into related events that we could
co-organise together with local meetup groups.

The Joint Python Accelerators project does not currently have an official Code
of Conduct (as none of our software projects). We will be working to adopt one
modeled after the Pandas Contributor Code of Conduct during this year.

Finally, we will organize and finance an intership on this projet through the
[Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org) organization.
