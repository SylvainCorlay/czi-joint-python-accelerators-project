# Milestones

## Phase 0 (June-October 2020)

- Solve Cython issues that are blockers for Transonic-Cython.

- New releases of Beniget, Gast and Transonic (cleaner and more robust
implementation).

- Demo package transonic_demo (repository and documentation).

- Pull-requests in skimage-experiments and scikit-image with simple use of
Transonic-Cython.

## Phase 1 (November 2020 - February 2021)

- Benchmarks on many numerical kernels (from scikit-image and other projects).
These benchmarks should be reproducible on different platforms and the results
will be made available on a website. We will propose to developers using other
languages to submit their own implementations for comparison. This website
should become a reference for comparison of performances on real scientific
algorithms of different technical solutions (using Python and other langages).

- Pull-requests in skimage-experiments and scikit-image for faster kernels
using alternative backends.

## Phase 2 (March-May 2021)

- Documentation of the packages Transonic and transonic_demo.

- Blog notes about the advancement of the project.

- One article presenting Transonic and the Joint Python Accelerators project
submitted to the Journal of Open Source Software.
