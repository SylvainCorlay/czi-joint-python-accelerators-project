# Institutional Approval Form (required)

This form should be reviewed and signed by a person authorized to sign on
behalf of your organization or fiscal sponsor (whichever organization that will
be receiving the grant funds, if the application is selected for funding),
agreeing to the stated institutional and applicant requirements and commitments
on data, resource sharing, and publication policies, as well as
endorsing/verifying your application materials and confirming their ability to
receive funding for the proposal and disperse funds to other projects named on
the application. Applicants may be asked to provide additional information on
the governance of the project and its ability to receive and use the funds, if
successfully awarded. If you do not have an organization identified to receive
funds, the applicant should sign the form and note on the form that a fiscal
sponsor has not been identified.
